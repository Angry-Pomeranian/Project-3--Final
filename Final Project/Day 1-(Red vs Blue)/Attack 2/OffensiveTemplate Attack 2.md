# Critical Vulnerabilities

The following vulnerabilities were identified on Target 2:

    - Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in PHPMailer, (CVE-2016-10033):
     BGet access to the web services and search for a lot of confidential information. Exploiting PHPMail with back connection (reverse shell) from the target.

    - Network Mapping and User Enumeration (WordPress site):
    Nmap was used to discover open ports. Able to discover open ports and tailor their attacks accordingly.

    - Weak Root Password:
    The root login had a weak password and the attackers were able to discover it by guessing. Able to correctly guess a root's password.

    - Misconfiguration of User Privileges/Privilege Escalation:
    The attackers noticed that the root user has sudo privileges for python. Able to utilize rootâ€™s python privileges in order to escalate for privilege to other folders.

# Exploitation

The Red Team was able to penetrate `Target 2` and retrieve the following confidential data:
## `flag1.txt`: SCREENSHOT hash-value: flag1{a2c1f66d2b8051bd3a5874b5b6e43e21
### Exploit Used:
- Enumerated WordPress site with Nikto and Gobuster to create a list of exposed URLs from the Target HTTP server and gather version information.
- Command: `nikto -C all -h 192.168.1.115`
Screenshot:
Determined the website is running on Apache/2.4.10 (Debian). Performed a more in-depth enumeration with Gobuster.
- Command: `sudo apt-get update`
- Command: `sudo apt-get install gobuster`
- Command: `gobuster -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster directory-list-2.3-medium.txt dir -u 192.168.1.115`
